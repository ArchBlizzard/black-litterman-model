# Black-Litterman Model for Asset Allocation

This project implements the Black-Litterman model to optimize asset allocation by incorporating subjective views and market equilibrium. It enhances traditional mean-variance optimization by integrating investor insights and adjusting for uncertainty in these views.

## Features

- **Subjective Views**: Model views based on historical data or random generation.
- **Confidence Levels**: Assigned based on stock volatility.
- **Market Adjustment**: Adjust views based on bullish, bearish, or volatile market conditions.
- **Backtesting & Stress Testing**: Evaluate model performance and test sensitivity to varying views and confidence.
